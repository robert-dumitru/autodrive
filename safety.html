		&emsp; You might be asking yourself why exactly we would want to give up control of the roads. </br> </br>

		<blockquote> <i> Before you move on, do you think we should start using self-driving cars? </i> </blockquote> </br>

		&emsp; Aside from the obvious convenience and time savings, AV technology promises to reduce human errors on the road. In the US alone, our flaws as humans when driving are related to over 90% of road accidents. This makes sense when we think about the amount of many tasks we have to juggle on a daily basis - jobs, relationships, and everything in between. Unfortunately, our preoccupations with other priorities lead to many deaths and injuries when driving. AV technology has the potential to significantly reduce these human errors and thus offer more safety. </br> </br>
		&emsp; Despite this large proposed improvement in road safety, you and many others might have reservations about jumping on the autonomous bandwagon. A US survey conducted by AAA in 2018 revealed that 73% of respondents would not ride in a fully self-driving vehicle, with only 13% expressing trust in AV. Countries outside the US, like India and Israel, express more safety concerns. </br> </br>
		&emsp; This pessimistic public opinion begs the question: what safety concerns are most prevalent for AV technology? If there are in fact a number of prevalent concerns, can they even be addressed? </br> </br>

		<blockquote> <i> Reflect: What do you think? </i> </blockquote> </br>

		&emsp; AV safety concerns can be divided into three main categories: AV technology, AV interactions with others, and hacking (external influences into AV decisions). </br> </br>
		&emsp; First, the safety concerns around the technology itself include AVâ€™s ability to sense others on the road. If the sensors fail either due to hardware or software issues, self-driving cars might cause road accidents. However, this can be addressed by both developing better sensors (researchers and manufacturers are already on this!) </br> </br>
		&emsp; Next, AV will have to interact with others on the road - this is a long list of passenger cars, buses, bikes, motorcycles, pedestrians, and so on. To be able to effectively prepare our roads for AV and prevent harm, roads can be better prepared for the new technology. These include lower speed limits, more speed bumps, separate bus, and bike lanes as well as higher visibility crosswalks and signs. </br> </br>
		&emsp; Both levels of safety measures, if thoroughly developed, will make it possible for us to enjoy the safety benefits of AV. </br> </br>

		<blockquote> <i> Reflect: How can we improve AV safety? </i> </blockquote> </br>

		&emsp; Last but not least, the most significant safety concern for many is the potential exposure of AV to hacking. While this is related to AV technology, it is such a big concern that we want to address it separately. If you recall, the start of the internet era was filled with hacking attacks. However, as time went on, we developed better methods for preventing these attacks. While hacking still occurs, we are now arguably better at addressing it. Well, the same can be expected for AV, where better hacking detection, careful data filtering, prevention from GPS intervention, and anti-virus systems can help us fight against hacking. </br> </br>
		&emsp; While it is true that AV technology can raise serious safety concerns, there are also many systematic ways to address these issues. At the end of the day, the question really is about reducing the most common reason of road accidents - human error. Despite the many uncertainties AV technology raises, we cannot deny that it still offers an improvement from our current vehicles. </br> </br>
