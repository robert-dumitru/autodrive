			&emsp; So how do Autonomous Vehicles work? In the simplest jargon that I can produce, AVs create a map of their environment using a variety of sensors and cameras to monitor the positions and speeds of nearby vehicles, as well as the traffic and road signals. Many of these sensors use fancy radar or lidar technology to observe the surrounding environment. Many companies developing self-driving cars, like Google, first create a pre-made map of the road systems by having employees drive around in vehicles equipped with lidar, or Light Detection and Ranging uses concentrated lights and lasers to measure distance and produce a map. Then the vehicles use onboard technology to observe other drivers, pedestrians, and road conditions. <br> <br>

			&emsp; The car’s software then processes all of these sensory inputs, plots a path, and tells the car what to do. Algorithmic rules, obstacle avoidance paths, predictive modeling, and game theory all help the software follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles. <br> <br>
			&emsp; However what if these sensory inputs are not accurate? Then the “map” the AV has created would be incorrect. Lidar technology bounces pulses of light off the car’s surroundings to measure distances, detect road edges, and identify lane markings. However, these sensors have some limitations. One safety concern is that obscuring light, for example, the sun glare off of a wet road, may interfere with the sensor’s ability to measure distances effectively. Additionally, intense weather like snow, heavy rain or fog may limit the lidar’s ability to “see.” This opens the car up to potentially severe accidents caused by seemingly innocuous incidents. <br> <br>
			&emsp; Using lidar in combination with other types of surveillance and observance technologies, however, may mitigate this risk as cameras and radar, alongside lidar, may triangulate upon accurate readings. Additionally, breakthroughs in radar technology, which are not so limited by weather, are contributing to better and fuller mapping systems of the road, leading to safer systems overall. Intuitively, as one rises to higher levels of automation, more of these sensors and technologies will need to be used to guarantee accuracy. So while level 2 autonomation may require 3 radar sensors and 1 camera, a level 5 AV may require more than 10 radar sensors, 8 cameras, and 1 lidar sensor on board. <br> <br>
			<blockquote> <i> Do you think a car equipped with all of these sensors can see better than you can? </i> </blockquote> </br>
			&emsp; The integration of these sensors is important but difficult to consider. However, there are existing functions like the Convolutional Neural Network, which take input data from each sensor, identify important elements, like pedestrians, lane markings, and other vehicles, to then output detection services guiding driving behavior. As a general rule, an increase in one level of automation requires around ten times more processing and computational power to integrate the information. <br> <br>
			&emsp; However, the technology used in these sensory systems is continuously improving, and the costs decreasing. when automated vehicles become an awe-inspiring reality, the technology may be even more equipped to handle all driving conditions. The technologies utilized to create and operate self-driving vehicles have the potential to open up the world up to the benefits of AVs, and may do so in a safe and efficient manner. <br> <br>
