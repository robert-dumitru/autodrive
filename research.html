			&emsp; So how do Autonomous Vehicles work? In the simplest jargon that I can produce, AVs create a virtual map of their environment using a variety of sensors and cameras to monitor the positions and speeds of nearby vehicles, as well as the traffic and road signals which the car must acknowledge to operate safely. Many of these sensors utilize radar or lidar technology to observe the surrounding environment.
			Sophisticated software then processes all this sensory input, plots a path, and sends instructions to the car’s actuators, which control acceleration, braking, and steering. Hard-coded rules, obstacle avoidance algorithms, predictive modeling, and object recognition help the software follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles. <br> <br>
			&emsp; However what if these sensory inputs are not accurate? Lidar technology bounces pulses of light off the car’s surroundings to measure distances, detect road edges, and identify lane markings. However, these sensors are subject to some limitations. One safety concern is that obscuring light, for example, the sun glare off of a wet road, may impede the sensor’s ability to measure distances effectively. This opens the car up to potentially severe accidents stemming from seemingly innocuous incidents. <br> <br>
			&emsp; Using lidar in combination with other types of surveillance and observance technologies, however, may mitigate this risk as the utilization of multiple camera, radar, and lidar sensors to triangulate upon accurate readings and sensory input will drastically reduce the risk of faulty equipment. Additionally, the technology used in these sensory systems is continually being improved upon, and when automated vehicles become an awe-inspiring reality, the technology may be even more equipped to handle all driving conditions. <br> <br>
			&emsp; Additionally, an unintended consequence of self-driving technology is that it opens the vehicle’s route and safety measures open to potential hacking. Without going into too much detail, autonomous vehicles similar to most processing systems on computers may be potentially vulnerable to competent hackers. As a result, the steering, brakes, and acceleration systems within AV technologies may be remotely controlled. <br> <br>
			&emsp; In order to combat this potentially terrifying occurrence, cooperation between automakers, security experts, and government agencies may result in a unified security architecture that is verified by security experts and follows governmental guidelines. Ensuring transparent communication between these three divisions will allow for more hardy security measures. <br> <br>
			&emsp; The technologies utilized to create and operate self-driving vehicles have the potential to open up the world to the benefits of AVs, and may do so in a safe and efficient manner. <br> <br>
