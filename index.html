			&emsp; For those of us who are not well-versed in driving, autonomous vehicles sound like a dream come true. Even if you drive well, there were probably times, perhaps after a long day at work, when you wished your car could transport you to your destination without your involvement. This dream, however, is much closer to reality than we can imagine, with autonomous vehicles already hitting the roads in the US. Autonomous vehicles, or self-driving cars, are vehicles that might help humans transport without driving and promise to greatly reduce road accidents as well as traffic <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. There are 5 different levels of automation with AV  <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>.  <br> <br>
			<div id="boxes">
				<p style="float: left;"> <img src="img/level1.jpg"> </p>
				<p> At the first level, you have to “co-drive” with your car. It can regulate its own speed or hit the brakes, but you must have your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road, ready to take over anytime.  </p>
			</div> </br> </br> </br> </br>
			<div id="boxes">
				<p style="float: left;"> <img src="img/level2.jpg"> </p>
				<p> At the next level, you can now rest your hands a little as your car is now able to steer the wheel, but your hands must still be on the wheel, ready to take over as this level is still largely dependent on the human driver. </p>
			</div> </br> </br> </br> </br>
			<div id="boxes">
				<p style="float: left;"> <img src="img/level3.jpg"> </p>
				<p> The third level allows you to take your eyes off the road for some time to text or watch movies. If there is an emergency, your car will alert you to start driving. </p>
			</div> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br>
			<div id="boxes">
				<p style="float: left;"> <img src="img/level4.jpg"> </p>
				<p> When we go to the fourth level, things are more relaxed - you can take a nap or leave your seat, but only within approved areas and conditions. </p>
			</div> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br>
			<div>
				<p style="float: left;"> <img src="img/level5.jpg"> </p>
				<p> And, finally, the fifth level requires no intervention from your side. </p>
			</div> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br>
			&emsp; So how will this car drive you? AV uses sensors and cameras to navigate the roads. AV promise to decrease traffic, accidents caused by human error, and the toll our transport can have on the environment. AV can also offer more comfortable transportation to those who cannot drive themselves because of disabilities and age. It will also free up many parking spaces thanks to the ability to self-park <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>. Safety seems to be the biggest advantage of self-driving cars as 90% of current road accidents are caused by human error <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. <br> <br>
			&emsp; Well, then why are we still stuck behind our wheels? Despite the optimistic picture the new technology paints, there are still many unanswered questions. Who will be the one to blame in accidents that happen? What if your car is hacked?  <br> <br>
			&emsp; Self-driving cars might also make certain jobs like drivers and car insurance specialists obsolete <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. On top of that, some studies have also shown that the new technology is not as skilled at recognizing dark-skinned pedestrians <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>. The technology will also be likely expensive when it first hits the roads - causing a disparity between people with different income levels.  <br> <br>
			&emsp; However, with its many promises and the amount of current research and investment in this field, autonomous vehicles will likely become part of our lives sooner or later <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.
