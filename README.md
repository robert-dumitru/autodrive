## autodrive

This Repository contains the source code for the AutoDrive civic project in collaboration with the Stanford Dynamic Design Lab. The aim was to educate and change the general public's perception on Autonomous Vehicles - we determined that a website would achieve these goals best.
The current hosted website can be accessed at [this link](https://robert-dumitru.github.io/autodrive/).
