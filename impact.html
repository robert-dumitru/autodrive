			&emsp; AVs have the potential to transform our world, with benefits ranging from increased efficiency to fewer accidents. Have you ever struggled to find a parking spot when in a rush? Level 5 AVs can drop you off at your destination and park on their own. When you need your AV again, you can simply call it and it will pick you up from anywhere you need. In this way, an AV can behave like your own personal taxi service. This would eliminate the need for so much parking in city centers, freeing up space for other uses like green spaces. <br> <br>
			&emsp; Sitting in traffic and rush hour will also become a thing of the past - AVs will have the capability to communicate with each other, helping reduce congestion on key roads while diverting traffic to underutilized ones. Every year, 3.1 billion gallons of fuel are wasted in traffic, so AV technology has the potential to save untold amounts of time, fuel, and money. <br> <br>
			&emsp; With AV technology, we may not need as many cars on the road as today. How much time do you actually spend in your car? The average person spends 1 hour behind the wheel every day, meaning for the other 23, their car is idle, taking up parking space. Self-driving cars could make ride-share programs like uber much more efficient and convenient, meaning that for the majority of people, owning a car may become unnecessary. <br> <br>
			&emsp; Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death, and over 90% of car accidents are caused by human factors. If AV technology becomes widespread, car accidents would become much less common, making travel safer for everyone. AV technology is not restricted to cars either - delivery vans and trucks could also use this technology, making deliveries quicker and less expensive. <br> <br>
			&emsp; These are just a few of the many applications and improvements that AVs could bring to our world - doubtless many more applications will become possible once AVs are more widespread. <br> <br>
